What I need to change, dependencies wise:

libaio -> we got it built/passing tests
libpmem -> replace with shm operations
libsyscall_intercept_hook_point -> no interception, just call the posix library directly. Maybe could work though.
linux/rbtree- just find these headers and patch, hopefully not too bad.
linux/seqlock

- rdmalib :)

Of course, change the Makefiles to remove unnecessary dependencies.

Other changes
- ip's should be dynamically configurable.

The blocks are stored in files in /backup/mlfs_hdd.
